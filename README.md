# TheOthers - This is a package with components created for Lazarus
The package currently contains:  
-TSelector, this component creates a rubberband and returns a bitmap. The component also has a predefined popup menu with several 
functions like copy, cut, rotate, save, etc.  
-TSizer, this component selected a area and returns the coordinates of a rect  
-TLayer, this component provides a page that can also be made invisible at design time.   
-TTextBox, this component can be used to output a text with a transparent background.    
I developed and tested it under Linux Mint 64bit. I compiled it under Windows 64 and 32 bit.
